## Description

This project is meant to assist people with planning their vacations. In this fastpaced environment, people tend to make mistakes and forget key things. With this project, my team worked to make the task of planning each day of a trip a little bit easier.

## Features

The main feature of this website would be the ability to select and generate a certain amount of vacation days. A block will be generated for each day, and in these blocks, you have the ability to edit the location and task for each day. Once this is done, you will get weather data for that day in that chosen location. You will also have access to a map button that will bring you to a map of the location.
