## Description

I made this project because making readme.md files from scratch for every project can feel tedious at times. This project should made the task much easier to deal with and come out looking professional in a timely manner.

## Usage
  
To use this project, you will first need to open the project in VS code. From there, you will open an integrated terminal and type in `npm install`. This will download the necessary packages for the project. You will then type `node index.js` into the terminal, which will then bring up the prompts that you should fill out. Once you fill out the prompts, your generated markdown file will have been created.
